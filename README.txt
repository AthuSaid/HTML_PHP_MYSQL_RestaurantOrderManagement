This project is a web-based system that will potentially reduce the load on 
wait staff for a sandwich restaurant.

This project is build with PHP and uses MySQL as its database back-end.

This project also includes the software engineering procedures:
  Part 1: Create SRS, class diagram, use cases;
  Part 2: Create user guide;
  Part 3: Create validation tests;
  Part 4: Implement the source codes and create unit tests;
  Part 5: Update SRS, class diagram, use cases and implementation after
          customer requests.

Customer Tablet Assignment

After tablet assignments it will auto redirect to this link:
Instore Customer Interface
http://students.cse.unt.edu/~kc0284/CustomerInterface/CustomerHomepage.php

Without tablet assignment, the link becomes:
Online Customer Interface
