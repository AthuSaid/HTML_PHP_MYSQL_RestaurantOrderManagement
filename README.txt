This project is a web-based system that will potentially reduce the load on 
wait staff for a sandwich restaurant.

This project is build with PHP and uses MySQL as its database back-end.

This project also includes the software engineering procedures:
  Part 1: Create SRS, class diagram, use cases;
  Part 2: Create user guide;
  Part 3: Create validation tests;
  Part 4: Implement the source codes and create unit tests;
  Part 5: Update SRS, class diagram, use cases and implementation after
          customer requests. 

Many thanks to my teammates Suraj Shrestha, Kelly Wu, John Kizhakeparampil
and Kevin Holmes for their invaluable contributions to this project.
